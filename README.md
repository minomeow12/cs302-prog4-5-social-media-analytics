# CS302 Programs 4–5 – Social Media Analytics (Python)

## Overview
This repository contains **Program 4 and Program 5** for **CS302 – Data Structures**.
Both projects focus on modeling and analyzing social media data using
object-oriented design and data structures implemented in Python.

- **Program 4** emphasizes an object-oriented class hierarchy
- **Program 5** extends the project using a tree-based data structure and recursion
- Unit testing is implemented using **PyTest**
## Program 4 – OOP Hierarchy
**Focus:**
- Python object-oriented programming
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Clean class design

**Concepts Used:**
- Base and derived classes
- Method overriding
- Encapsulation

---

## Program 5 – Tree-Based Analytics
**Focus:**
- Tree data structure (Red-Black Tree)
- Recursive traversal and operations
- Extended analytics functionality

**Concepts Used:**
- Trees and recursion
- Node-based data organization
- Algorithmic data processing
